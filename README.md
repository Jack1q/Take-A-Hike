# Take-A-Hike
Uses Geocoding API and the haversine formula to determine the nearest hiking trails in Connecticut and sort them based on distance from current position.

# To-do
- get current location without user input
- tell users whether they can bring dogs to trails, better parking info
- change distance calculation in the future- the haversine formula determines the distance as if one is traveling in a straight line. revise it so that it gets actual street travel distance
